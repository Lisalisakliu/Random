Three Main types of Application:
  Native App
    IOS: Object-C/Swift
    Android: JAVA/Kotlin
    Pros: 
      1.Better user experience
      2.can use all hardware and software APIs of the system,eg GPS, camera,mricophone,notification push;realize full potential of the system;
    Cons:
      1.Cost. Each mobile platform need to establish a team independentally. (ios, Android, WindowsPhone)
      2.The native App uses underlying operatiing system language, all are complicated language.  Development and testing period are long. 
      3.Native apps must be downloaded and installed to be used. User have to download and install again as long as there is new vision. 
      If users don't update them, vendors have to support old vision for a long time. 
  Web App
    Pro: 
      1.do not need to download and install, used by open browse, always the newest virsion. 
      2.For developer, easy to develop, no app store approvel to publish
    Cons:
      1.Browsers provide limited API (camera, GPS,battery, Microphone). Most system hardware cannot be accessible through web. 
      2.Webpages are played by browser, the performance is not as good as native app. 
  Hybrid App
    native app + web app
    Pro:
      1.Cross platform, save cost;
      2.Flexibility. 
      3.Easy to develop.
    Cons:
      1.Performance is worse than native app. 
      2.Can't use the features which are only available on specific platform. (eg, Iphone home butter, Android back butter)
